# üöÄ Mitra AI : Blockchain Smart wallet AI Chatbot

> Your Crypto Guide, Always by Your Side!
---

## üìå Problem Statement
- Modern blockchain wallets are powerful but often confusing for new users. There is a lack of intuitive, conversational interfaces that allow users to interact with their wallets easily and securely. The goal is to bridge this gap by creating an AI-powered chatbot interface for smart wallets.

---

## üéØ Objective
- To develop a conversational AI chatbot named Mitra AI that integrates with a blockchain wallet and simplifies wallet operations (like checking balances, sending tokens, viewing transaction history) using natural language processing.
